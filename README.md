# RandomItemGiver
 Phoenix SC's RandomItemGiver with some optimizations and improvements. The original RandomItemGiver can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kFPn0BBYY

This version is almost exactly the same as the original but now has multiplayer support. Each online player will receive a random item every X amount of ticks specified in the main.mcfunction file. Performance in this version is drastically improved.
