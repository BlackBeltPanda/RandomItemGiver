# RandomItemGiver
 Phoenix SC's RandomItemGiver with some optimizations and improvements

This version is almost exactly the same as the original but now has multiplayer support. Each online player will receive a random item every X amount of ticks specified in the main.mcfunction file. Performance in this version is drastically improved.
