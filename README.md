# RandomItemGiver

A unique twist on the usual Minecraft gameplay, RandomItemGiver gives all players a random item every 5 seconds. From dirt blocks to diamond armor and everything in between; how will you manage the constant, unstoppable influx of random items? Good luck!

You can customize the amount of time before a new random item is given by specifying how many ticks should pass in the `main.mcfunction` file.
